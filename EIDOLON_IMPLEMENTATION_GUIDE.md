# Eidolon Implementation Guide

## 1. How We Can Make Eidolon Possible

### A. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core MVP (Text-based Assistant)
1. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Organize folders: `assistant/`, `models/`, `data/`, etc.
2. **Integrate Quantized LLM (e.g., Phi-2, Mistral) via llama.cpp**
   - Download quantized model (GGUF format)
   - Compile llama.cpp and test basic prompt/response
3. **Implement Text Input/Output Loop**
   - `main.py` handles user input, calls LLM, prints response
4. **Add Basic Emotion Detection**
   - Start with keyword-based or simple ML classifier for text
5. **Build Prompt Builder**
   - Inject emotion/context into LLM prompt
6. **Implement Memory Logging**
   - Store interactions in `data/logs.json` (input, emotion, response)
7. **Add Simple Command Execution**
   - Map certain intents to system commands (e.g., time, open app)

#### Phase 2: Voice & Emotion (Multimodal)
1. **Integrate Speech-to-Text (STT)**
   - Use Whisper.cpp or Vosk for offline voice input
2. **Integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - Use Coqui TTS, RHVoice, or eSpeak-NG for voice output
3. **Enhance Emotion Detection**
   - Add ML-based emotion classifier (e.g., EmoRoBERTa, DistilBERT)
   - Optionally, add voice-based emotion detection (pyAudioAnalysis)

#### Phase 3: Memory, Learning & Optimization
1. **Implement Efficient Memory Store**
   - Use quantized embeddings (MiniLM, GIST) + FAISS/SQLite for recall
   - Store only top-K relevant memories
2. **Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Retrieve relevant memories and inject into LLM prompt
3. **Optimize for Low RAM/Mobile**
   - Aggressive quantization (4-bit, 3-bit)
   - Use llama.cpp, TFLite, or ONNX Runtime for inference
   - Profile and minimize memory/CPU usage
4. **Enable Continual Learning**
   - Explore LoRA/QLoRA for on-device fine-tuning
   - Implement prioritized, privacy-preserving learning

#### Phase 4: Extensibility & UI
1. **Add Modular Task Executor**
   - Support for plugins (IoT, web search, smart home, etc.)
2. **Develop Mobile/CLI UI**
   - Termux wrapper for Android, or Flutter/React Native app
3. **Security & Privacy**
   - Ensure all data is processed and stored locally
   - Add user controls for memory and permissions

### B. Key Technical Strategies
- **Quantization:** Use 4-bit/8-bit models and quantized embeddings to fit LLMs and memory on low-RAM devices.
- **Efficient Inference Engines:** Use llama.cpp, TFLite, or ONNX Runtime for fast, local inference.
- **Modular Design:** Each component (STT, TTS, LLM, memory, emotion) is a separate module for easy upgrades.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Use a vector store to simulate long-term memory without bloating the LLM.
- **Emotion Conditioning:** Feed detected emotion as context to the LLM for more human-like responses.
- **Privacy by Design:** No cloud calls; all learning and storage is local.

## 2. Key Pain Points & Challenges

### 1. **Resource Constraints**
- **RAM/Storage:** Fitting LLMs, embeddings, and audio models on 2–4GB RAM devices is challenging.
- **CPU/Inference Speed:** Ensuring real-time responses on mobile CPUs.

### 2. **Model Quality vs. Size**
- **Trade-off:** Smaller models are faster but less capable; quantization can degrade quality.
- **Emotion & Context:** Small models may struggle with nuanced emotion/context understanding.

### 3. **Efficient Memory/Knowledge Storage**
- **Embedding Size:** Storing many embeddings can still bloat storage.
- **Recall:** Fast, relevant retrieval on-device is non-trivial.

### 4. **Continual Learning**
- **On-Device Fine-Tuning:** Most LLMs are not designed for incremental updates on-device.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Avoiding loss of old knowledge when learning new things.

### 5. **Speech Processing**
- **STT/TTS Model Size:** Even small models can be large for mobile.
- **Latency:** Real-time voice interaction is demanding.

### 6. **Emotion Detection**
- **Accuracy:** Emotion detection from text/voice is imperfect, especially with small models.
- **Multimodal Fusion:** Combining text and audio emotion signals efficiently.

### 7. **Integration & Modularity**
- **Component Interfacing:** Ensuring all modules communicate efficiently and robustly.
- **Extensibility:** Making it easy to add new skills or swap models.

### 8. **User Privacy & Security**
- **Data Handling:** Ensuring no data leaks, even in logs or memory.
- **User Control:** Allowing users to manage/delete their data easily.

## 3. Summary & Recommendations
- **Start simple:** Build a minimal, text-only pipeline first.
- **Iterate:** Add voice, emotion, and memory in phases.
- **Profile constantly:** Measure RAM, CPU, and storage at every step.
- **Research:** Stay updated on new small models, quantization, and efficient learning techniques.
- **Community:** Engage with open-source communities for models and optimization tips.
