# LLM Ensemble Implementation Guide for Eidolon

## 1. Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building a multi-LLM ensemble system for Eidolon, enabling you to combine the strengths of several small language models for improved accuracy, robustness, and flexibility—while remaining efficient for low-resource devices.

## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Prototyping a Simple Ensemble
1. **Select and Prepare Models**
   - Choose 2–3 quantized small LLMs (e.g., Phi-2, TinyLlama, Qwen) in GGUF or TFLite format.
   - Ensure each model is accessible via a common interface (e.g., llama.cpp CLI or Python wrapper).

2. **Design a Unified Inference API**
   - Create a Python module (e.g., `ensemble.py`) that can send a prompt to each model and collect their responses.

3. **Implement Voting or Fusion Logic**
   - Start with simple majority voting or rule-based selection (e.g., prefer the most confident or least repetitive answer).
   - Optionally, logit/entropy-based confidence scoring if available.

4. **Build a Test Harness**
   - Create scripts to send sample prompts to the ensemble and compare outputs.
   - Log all responses for later analysis.

### Phase 2: Specialization and Routing
1. **Fine-Tune or Specialize Models**
   - Fine-tune each LLM for a specific domain (e.g., emotion, logic, factual QA) if resources allow.

2. **Implement a Router/Gating Mechanism**
   - Use a lightweight classifier or rule-based system to direct each prompt to the most suitable model(s).
   - Example: If the prompt contains emotional language, route to the emotion-specialized LLM.

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - For complex queries, combine outputs (e.g., merge, re-rank, or synthesize responses).
   - Use a meta-model or simple heuristics for fusion.

### Phase 3: Optimization and Evaluation
1. **Profile Resource Usage**
   - Measure RAM, CPU, and latency for single and multi-model inference.
   - Quantize further if needed (4-bit, 3-bit).

2. **Evaluate Output Quality**
   - Use benchmarks, human evaluation, or task-specific metrics to compare ensemble vs. single model.
   - Track consistency, accuracy, and diversity.

3. **Iterate and Distill**
   - If the ensemble outperforms any single model, consider distilling its knowledge into a single, smaller model for efficiency.

## 3. Example Code Structure
```
ensemble/
├── __init__.py
├── base_model.py         # Wrapper for LLM inference (CLI or API)
├── ensemble.py           # Voting/fusion logic
├── router.py             # Routing/gating logic
└── test_harness.py       # Evaluation scripts
```

---

## 4. Example Workflow
1. **User prompt received**
2. **Router decides** which LLM(s) to use
3. **Prompt sent** to selected models
4. **Responses collected**
5. **Ensemble logic** (voting/fusion) selects or synthesizes final answer
6. **Final response returned** to user

---

## 5. Best Practices for Low-Resource Environments
- **Aggressive Quantization:** Use 4-bit or lower precision models
- **Lazy Loading:** Only load models into memory when needed
- **Batching:** If possible, batch requests to minimize overhead
- **Profiling:** Continuously monitor resource usage and optimize
- **Fallbacks:** If resources are low, fall back to a single best model

---

## 6. Advanced Topics
- **Confidence Estimation:** Use model logits or entropy to estimate answer reliability
- **Meta-Learning:** Train a small controller to select or combine model outputs
- **Distillation:** Periodically distill ensemble knowledge into a single model
- **Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Fusion:** Combine LLMs with rule-based or knowledge-graph modules for even more robust answers
