# Eidolon Learning Guide: Building an Offline AI Assistant from Scratch

Welcome to the Eidolon learning journey! This guide documents every major step taken in this project, explaining the reasoning, AI/ML concepts, and practical skills involved. Use this as a roadmap to learn how to build, optimize, and deploy modern AI systems.

---

## 1. Project Vision & Planning
- **Goal:** Build an offline, modular, emotionally intelligent AI assistant that runs on low-RAM/mobile devices.
- **Why:** Most AI assistants are cloud-based and resource-hungry. Eidolon aims for privacy, efficiency, and adaptability.
- **Skills:** Project scoping, requirements gathering, system design.

---

## 2. Model Selection & Quantization
- **Step:** Research and select small, open-source LLMs (e.g., Phi-2, TinyLlama, Mistral, Qwen) that can be quantized for low-resource use.
- **Why:** Large models are powerful but require lots of RAM/compute. Quantized models (e.g., GGUF format) run efficiently on CPUs and mobile devices.
- **Concepts:** Model quantization, parameter reduction, trade-offs between size and accuracy.

  - [Quantization in ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061)

---

## 3. Model Management & Download Automation
- **Step:** Create scripts (download_models.sh) and documentation for fetching models.
- **Why:** Large models should not be stored in git. Automation ensures reproducibility and easy onboarding.
- **Skills:** Shell scripting, open-source best practices.

---

## 4. Ensemble System Prototyping
- **Step:** Build a Python system to run multiple LLMs and combine their outputs (ensemble/base_model.py, ensemble/ensemble.py).
- **Why:** Ensembling leverages the strengths of different models, improving robustness and accuracy.
- **Concepts:** Ensemble learning, majority voting, model specialization.
- **Resources:**
  - [Ensemble Methods in ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)

---

## 5. CLI, Batch, and Configurable Workflows
- **Step:** Add CLI and batch prompt support, and use config.yaml for model paths.
- **Why:** Flexibility for both interactive and automated testing. Config files make team setup easy.
- **Skills:** Python scripting, YAML, user experience design.

---

## 6. Containerization (Docker)
- **Step:** Write a Dockerfile to containerize the environment, including building llama.cpp and installing dependencies.
- **Why:** Ensures everyone on the team has the same environment, regardless of OS. Simplifies deployment.
- **Concepts:** Docker, reproducible environments, mounting volumes.
- **Resources:**
  - [Docker Official Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)

---

## 7. Local Automation
- **Step:** Add setup_local.sh to automate local setup (clone/build llama.cpp, install Python deps).
- **Why:** Lowers the barrier for new contributors and ensures consistency.
- **Skills:** Bash scripting, environment management.

---

## 8. Documentation & Learning Materials
- **Step:** Write detailed README, setup guides, and this learning guide.
- **Why:** Good documentation is essential for collaboration, onboarding, and knowledge transfer.
- **Skills:** Technical writing, knowledge sharing.

---

## 9. Research & Best Practices
- **Step:** Summarize research on ensembling, quantization, and efficient AI in dedicated docs.
- **Why:** Staying up-to-date with the latest research ensures the project uses state-of-the-art methods.
- **Concepts:** Literature review, applied research.

---

## 10. Next Steps & Further Learning
- **Expand the system:** Add speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), memory, and emotion modules.
- **Experiment:** Try different ensemble strategies, model specializations, and optimizations.
- **Contribute:** Share your findings, improvements, and new modules with the community.
