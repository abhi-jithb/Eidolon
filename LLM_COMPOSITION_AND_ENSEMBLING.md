# Composing Multiple Small LLMs: Ensembling and Hybrid Architectures for Eidolon

## 1. Concept Overview

Instead of relying on a single small LLM (which may have limited capabilities), we can connect multiple small LLMs—each with unique strengths—into a composite system. The goal is to:
- Leverage the positive points of each model
- Use one model to cover the mistakes or weaknesses of another
- Achieve higher accuracy, robustness, and flexibility without requiring a single large model

This approach is inspired by ensemble learning, mixture-of-experts, and modular AI architectures.

## 2. Possible Architectures

### A. Ensemble Voting
- **How it works:** Multiple LLMs generate responses independently. The system selects the best response via majority vote, confidence scoring, or a meta-classifier.
- **Use case:** Fact-checking, reducing hallucinations, improving answer reliability.

### B. Cascading (Fallback) System
- **How it works:** A primary LLM handles most queries. If it is uncertain or fails (e.g., low confidence, out-of-domain), the query is passed to a secondary LLM specialized in that area.
- **Use case:** Intent detection, error correction, domain-specific expertise.

### C. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
- **How it works:** Each LLM is specialized (e.g., one for logic, one for emotion, one for code). A router or gating mechanism selects which LLM(s) to use for each input.
- **Use case:** Multi-skill assistants, context-aware routing, efficient specialization.

### D. Response Fusion (Hybrid Generation)
- **How it works:** Combine outputs from multiple LLMs (e.g., merge, re-rank, or synthesize responses). A meta-model or rule-based system fuses the best parts of each output.
- **Use case:** Creative tasks, summarization, nuanced dialogue.

### E. Error Correction/Refinement
- **How it works:** One LLM generates a response, another LLM (or a sequence of LLMs) reviews and corrects it, similar to a human editor.
- **Use case:** Grammar correction, fact-checking, style adaptation.

## 3. Technical Strategies
- **Confidence Estimation:** Use logit scores, entropy, or external classifiers to estimate each LLM's confidence in its output.
- **Specialization:** Fine-tune each LLM for a specific domain (emotion, logic, factual QA, etc.) to maximize complementary strengths.
- **Routing/Gating:** Implement a lightweight router (ML model or rules) to direct queries to the most suitable LLM(s).
- **Meta-LLM or Controller:** Use a small controller model to select, combine, or re-rank outputs.
- **Knowledge Distillation:** After ensembling, distill the combined knowledge into a single, smaller model for efficiency.

## 4. Challenges & Pain Points
- **Latency:** Running multiple LLMs increases inference time and resource usage.
- **Memory Footprint:** Even small models add up; careful quantization and model selection are needed.
- **Integration Complexity:** Routing, fusing, and managing multiple models is non-trivial.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring coherent, non-contradictory responses across models.
- **Training Data:** Requires diverse, high-quality data for specialization and meta-models.
- **Evaluation:** Harder to benchmark and debug compared to a single model.

## 5. Research Directions
- **Dynamic Ensembling:** Adaptive systems that select models based on context, user, or task.
- **Meta-Learning:** Training a controller to learn which LLM to trust for which input.
- **Distillation:** Compressing the ensemble's knowledge into a single efficient model.
- **Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Systems:** Combine LLMs with rule-based or knowledge-graph modules for even greater robustness.
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling:** Dynamically allocate models based on available RAM/CPU.

## 6. Practical Steps for Eidolon
1. **Prototype a Voting Ensemble:** Run two or more quantized LLMs, compare outputs, and select the best via simple rules.
2. **Specialize Models:** Fine-tune small LLMs for emotion, logic, or factual QA, and route queries accordingly.
3. **Implement a Router:** Use intent detection or confidence scoring to decide which model(s) to use per query.
4. **Experiment with Distillation:** After ensemble success, try distilling the ensemble into a single model.
5. **Benchmark:** Measure accuracy, latency, and resource usage to find the best trade-off.

## 7. Summary
Composing multiple small LLMs is a promising way to build a more capable, robust, and flexible assistant on low-resource devices. While it introduces new challenges, careful design and research can yield a system that outperforms any single small model—pushing the boundaries of what is possible for on-device AI like Eidolon.
